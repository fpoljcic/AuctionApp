This repository was used for developing a web auction app as an internship project for [Atlantbh](https://www.atlantbh.com/). The internship lasted 3 months, it started on the 14th September, 2020 and ended on the 20th December, 2020. The tasks were given to me through Trello and in total I finished 31 tasks, fixed 65 bugs and implemented 25 improvements suggested by QA.
